We try to divide prefabs for experiments into general experiment prefabs and experiment-specific prefabs. 

For general experiment prefabs, they stay in this folder.
They would appear in every experiment scene. If a certain experiment would not utilize it, simply uncheck the box for that prefab in the scene. Do not apply the changes back to the prefab.

For experiment-specific prefabs, create an appropriate folder (such as Exp1) and place it inside.
