/// <summary>
/// Core is a class using the Singleton Design Pattern. It is meant as the one stop for your common needs.
/// Under Core, there are a variety of Modules (may be called Manager or Controllers) that will perform commonly used
/// functionalities for their respective area. These modules should not contain scene-specific functionalities.  
/// For example, the Audio Module allows other scripts to adjust volume levels or request a new song.
/// A in-game VR music player with buttons would go through Core's Audio Module to play music and adjust volume, but
/// it will have code for responding to button pushes in a separate script.
/// 
/// Setup Note:
/// In Project Setting, Script Execution Order, Core should be very early to ensure it is available for other scripts.
/// Otherwise Public variables may not be assigned in inspectors when others try to interact with it in Awake
/// </summary>
